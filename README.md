## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Eliseo Garza, and I'm originally from Houston, TX. Currently, I'm an undergraduate student studying computer science at Texas A&M University in College Station, TX graduating in December 2025.

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for building efficient, impactful solutions. I enjoy solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies to expand my knowledge and give back to others.

In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, playing soccer, going to the gym, playing ping-pong, or hanging out with friends!
